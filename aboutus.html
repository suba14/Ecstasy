	<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
	<p>Ecstasy Motor Cars is dedicated to providing an exceptional customer experience. Our customers can be assured of the highest standard of service and professionalism, ensuring that choosing a Rolls-Royce Motor Car is as unforgettable an experience as the vehicles themselves.</p>
<p>Ecstasy Motor Cars is renowned for the highest level of professionalism and advice. Our sales and service staff provide an experience in line with the Ecstasy Motor Cars marque, known for creating the ultimate in motoring.</p>
 <h2>A NEW VISION</h2>
<p>Ecstasy is synonymous with limitless imagination. Our driving ambition — to inspire greatness — embodies the same restless curiosity that spurs artists into new terrain.

Now we are launching Muse, a forward-looking vision that fosters creativity through collaboration with artists who share our passion for pushing technical and conceptual boundaries.

A legacy of exceptional artistic achievements will be established via two ongoing initiatives: The Dream Commission and The Spirit of Ecstasy Challenge.</p>
 <h2>THE SPIRIT OF ECSTASY</h2>
<p>A celebration of both tradition and innovation, The Spirit of Ecstasy Challenge asks creative virtuosi to re-imagine the sculptural figurine that graces the bonnet of Ecstasy motor cars.

Three renowned practitioners will be invited to experiment with a material that is key to Ecstasy, such as leather, wood, glass, aluminium or carbon fibre. They will be encouraged to push the limits of the selected material and create objects that surprise, delight and inspire.

Each participant will visit the home of Estasy in Goodwood, England, where they will meet with our master craftspeople before completing their creations. Final works will then go on tour worldwide — including to Ecstasy showrooms — where they will be admired by art, design and car enthusiasts alike.</p>
<h2>INDIVIDUAL EXPRESSION</h2>
<p>When you commission a Ecstasy, our Bespoke team collaborate with you to make more than a distinctive design. Through detailed drawings, computer-generated blueprints and master craftsmanship, they strive to bring your idea of perfection to life.</p>
